# ezDeFi Technical Paper

## Introduction

This is the detail technical paper of ezDeFi, focusing on describing the operation of a consensus protocol called Relay-friendly,unbiasedly Randomized Proof of Stake (r2PoS), which was inspired by *Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work* (Kiayias, Miller, and Zindros, 2018) and *Light Clients and Proof of Stake* (Butterin, 2015) with improvement from ezDeFi by introducing Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) to achieve a decentralized system and bring a highly incentive system for blockchain maintainers.

In addition to NTY coin-base, r2PoS has the secondary token named ZD. ZD is used for authorizing an account to become the maintainer/sealer of the confirmation system described detail in , as well as to calculate reward for block sealer. The power of ezDeFi, however, is not belong to ZD holders because they could be voted down by ezDeFi community if community found that ZD holders did any bad behavior of cheating, malicious or hand-shaking to make the network become centralize chain as well as using out-of-date source code. As a result, ZD holders have the only role as block sealer for ezDeFi blockchain and governed by NTY community via decentralize voting system.

## How to Authorize an account to be a block sealer

The system will set up a configuration parameter to define the minimum value, 20,000 ZD, that an account need to deposit into ezDeFi governance smart contract to become a block sealer. ezDeFi will build and develop a governance smart contract, which allow ZD token holder, having enough token, to grant another account called “executing-account” to become the block sealer by setting“authorized-sealer” state in the smart contract with the value equal to address of ZD holder.

If an address already has an “authorized-sealer” value, it can not receive authorization from another ZD holder until the ZD holder has made the withdrawal it from “authorized-sealer”. The "authorized-sealer" list will be determined at the check point block of each epoch by reading canonical state from the smart contract at that point of time. If in the last three epochs, any “authorized-sealer” does not perform at least one sealing activity, the “authorized-sealer” value will slash by updating the state of the smart contract at the checkpoint block number of the next epoch and of course that “authorized-sealer” will not be involved in the next epoch until it will be authorized to become “authorized-sealer” again via community voting dapp.
