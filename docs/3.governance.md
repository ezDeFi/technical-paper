# Governance

This section will describe detail implementation of registration smart contract deployed at address *0x12345* using for consensus system.

## Terminology

**sealer**: a participant in the ezDeFi consensus system. You can become one by depositing DEPOSIT_SIZE ZDs into the ezDeFi mechanism.

**active sealer set**: those sealer who are currently participating, and which the ezDeFi mechanism looks to seal blocks and other consensus objects.

**withdrawal period**: number of epochs between a sealer exit and the sealer balance being withdraw-able.

**coinbase**: the account address that sealer will use to sign when sealing block.

**registration contract**: a smart contract for handling ezDeFi consensus mechanism.

## Constants

|Constant| Value| Unit|
|----------|---------|----|
|BLOCK_TIME| 2 |seconds|
|EPOCH_LENGTH| 3,000| blocks|
|DEPOSIT_SIZE| 20,000 |ZD|
|WITHDRAWAL_PERIOD| 30,000| blocks|

## Sealer status codes

**PENDING_ACTIVE = 0**: Sealer
deposited enough ZDs into registration contract successfully.

**ACTIVE = 1**: Sealer send request to
become a sealer and added into activation sealer set successfully.

**PENDING_WITHDRAW = 2**:
Sealer send request to exit from activation sealer set successfully. Sealer casted out of activation sealer set.

**WITHDRAWN = 3**: Sealer already
withdrawn their deposit ZDs successfully. They can only make withdrawal after withdrawal period.

**PENALIZED = 127**: Sealer marked
as penalized node (update by consensus or voting result via dapp) and
cannot become active sealer and cannot withdraw balance neither.

## ezDeFi chain registration contract

A registration contract is added to the ezDeFi
chain to deposit ZD and activation sealer
set management. It has some below basic
functions:

## Sealer Operations

Deposit: Transfer the ZD from token holder to registration contract.
Sealer might have to approve contract to transfer an amount of ZD
before calling this function.

Join: To allow deposited ZD participate joining in as sealer. Participate already must deposit enough
ZD via Deposit function. it takes
coinbase as parameter.

Exit: Request to exit out of activation
sealer set.

Withdraw: To withdraw sealer’s ZD
balance when they already exited
and after withdrawal period.

## Sealer Record.

Coinbase address: sealer’s coinbase
address to sign when sealing block

Balance: the total amount of ZD
that sealer has deposited

Status: Sealer status code

Requested Block Number: The
block number at which sealer send
request to exit out of activation
sealer set.

## How to become a sealer

(1) A participant should deposit at least
DEPOSIT_SIZE ZD into registration contract, a.k.a the network have
maximum 200 candidate nodes can
become a sealer. Sealer status will
be set to PENDING_ACTIVE.

(2) A participant need to set their coinbase to seal the block and receive reward on their equivalent ZD token
holder address.

(3) A participant call registration contract method to become sealer.
Sealer status be updated to ACTIVE.

(4) At next checkpoint of the epoch,
sealer request be cast and the sealer
be added into consensus activation
sealer set.

## How to exit from activation sealer and ZD withdrawal

(1) Sealer call registration contract
method to request for exiting
from activation sealer set and
sealer status be updated to PENDING_WITHDRAW but still in the
activation sealer set on the current
epoch.

(2) At next checkpoint of the epoch,
sealer exit request be cast and the
sealer be removed out of activation
sealer set.

(3) Sealer can call register contract
method to withdrawn their deposited ZD after a withdrawal period. The sealer status be changed to
WITHDRAWN after sealer withdraw
the ZD successfully.

## Sealer authorization

When a node
starting with –mine option then they need
to unlock the unique coinbase account setting in the activation sealer set. If the coinbase was not found in the current epoch activation sealer set then unauthorization
error will be throw and it cannot start mining but they still can continue to sync block
preparing for sealing later.

## Penalized 

At the checkpoint of each
epoch, consensus will collect the data from
the chain to find out any sealers that didn’t
seal any blocks 3 epochs in a row. Then
to ensure the network healthy, those sealers will be removed out of the **activation sealer set** in the new epoch and mark
sealer’s status as PENALIZED. Because, offline sealers may due to the nature of unstable global network and dis-continue infrastructure service that out of control of the
sealers. Then all PENALIZED sealers then
can be unlock the slash after voting up by
NTY community via a specific voting smart
contract as well as dapp.

# Block sealer reward calculation

[//]: # (Reward will be added immediately into sealer’s account balance after sealing ablock. The reward for a block is equalto the number of rewards per year dividedby **15,768,000**, the expected number of block within one year) 

The amount of
rewards of each block sealing in a specific
year is calculated in the following proportions:

|Year|  ZD/Block |
|----|--------|
|1 |2| 
|2| 2 |
|3| 2 |
|...| 2|
|n |2|

# Anti-Spam

## Most Frequency Use

In ezDeFi
blockchain, we allow end user to perform
transaction with zero fee. Therefore, we
introduce a mechanism to priority transactions base on some other factors other than
using only the gasprice. The first factor is
similar to stamina, each account will have
a most frequency use state. whenever,
transaction from account to include in the
block then the most frequency use, *∆new*,
will be update as following formula.

(1)
![Governance formula #1](../../img/tech-governance1.png "Governance Formula #1")

***block***: is the block number that transaction was include.

***GasUsed***: gas used by the transaction

Ideally, the higher most frequency use
value, the less priority of the account’s transaction in the transaction pool. And each
time an account perform the transaction,
most frequency use value of that account
will be increase; as a result, the next transaction of the same account will be less priority. And to avoid spam by new account, the
most frequency use of a new account will
be the block number of the account’s first
transaction.

## Transaction Parity 

Along with
most frequency use above, we introduce
a new factor to decide the priority of the
transaction called parity and will be calculated as below

(2) 
![Governance formula #2](../../img/tech-governance2.png "Governance formula #2")

***∆act***: most frequency use value of
the account when perform transaction

***TxGasLimit***: transaction gas limit,
the higher gas limit transaction, the
less priority

***TxGasPrice***: transaction gas price,
can be input arbitrarily by user.
User can put higher gas price if they
want to make transaction be confirmed faster.

***ParityLimit***: parity limit be configured by miner, the higher parity
limit, the less transaction gas price effect into the overall parity value, ρt

Overall, a transaction was include in the
miner’s txpool with priority base on the
value of transaction parity calculated in formula (10) then even though ezDeFi allow
user to send tnx with zero fee but sealer’s
pool can arbitrarily setting parameters to
utilize the sealer’s resource for anti spamming transaction and ensure normal user’s
transaction to be proceed without delay.

## Transaction Proof of Work

In the
near future, when the ezDeFi chain will be
fulfilled or be spammed by unmeaning transactions, we will introduce a mechanism to
avoid those kind of problem by enforcing
user to send a proof of mini work along with
the transaction, the transaction with valid
proof will be sealed in the block with highest
priority. To make a better user experience
and adoption, we will develop this feature
in user wallet; when the transaction confirmation is too slow, wallet will allow user to
take action to do transaction proof of work
on their wallet before sending transaction.
