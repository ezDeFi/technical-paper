# Secret Storing Library

## Architecture

### Secret Sharing Lib

Assume the split/combine secret function: split secret S to n elements such that if k (k <= n) any of those n parts is known, an S.

Application Algorithm: Shamir's Secret Sharing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing) Can take advantage of the library available at https://github.com/amper5and/secrets.js and wrap it up according to the
required to use.

### Storage AccessAn interface for abstraction of storage, reading secret shared data from different storage providers.

An interface for abstraction of storage, reading secret shared data from different storage providers.

By implementing this interface, any storage provider can be added to support secret share storage.

### Authorizer

An interface that has abstraction functions for authentication and authorization of the storage provider.

The authorizer will be impemented depending on the type of storage provider. For example, with a storage provider that is a cloud service and supports Oauth, Authorizer will be implemented as an Oauth client.

### Storage Provider

Provides data storage services to store secret shares. The storage provider can be a cloud storage service (like google drive, onedrive, dropbox, ...) or any kind of storage (eg local computer, private server, ...).

The Storage provider needs to implement the Storage Access interface in order to be able to plug into the system.

### Storages Manager

Functions to manage the storage providers list: add, remove, configure, ... for providers.

### Secret Storing Common Lib

Implements lib's flow logic and provides exported functions so that environment target libs can be called or re-exported in the form of API.

### Browser Extension App Targeting

A lib version with APIs targeted for browser extension environments (supporting Chrome and MS Edge in the short term).

In addition, the Oauth Clients (for Google, Microsoft, Dropbox, ...) are also provided to serve the user's cloud service login process. Oauth client needs to implement the Authorizer interface.

Note: since Oauth flow is an independent process, in which the oauth server returns an authorization code or access token by callingback (redirect) to a URI declared (configured) first, therefore, Oauth client needs to be implemented at each target. environment is different, not in the environment
core lib.

## Main Interaction Flows

This section describes the main interaction flows between secret storage lib and external actors.

The objects mentioned in the diagrams below include:

sslib: secret Storing lib, the subject described in this document
App: application that uses sslib. Maybe a browser extension app, mobile app, ...
Oauth Provider: Oauth service, such as google oauth, microsoft oauth, ...
Storage Provider: data storage service. For example: google drive, onedrive, ...
User: user, interacting directly with the App

In the diagrams below, the actions occurring between User and App are only suggestive or illustrative for the use case but not required; Actions between User and App are outside the scope of lib.


### Storage Service Authorization

The diagram below describes the flow of how user gain access to storage service (in the form of an access token).

Other forms of authorization of other types of storage services (not supporting oauth), if any, will be described separately.

### Storing Secret

The main input parameters for the flow of storing a secret:

* id: identifier (Eg .: in case of storing eth private key, you can give id = eth address)
* secret: the content of the secret to be saved
* providers []: the list of storage providers which secret will be stored
* threshold: the threshold for the required sharing parts to enable secret recovery (threshold <= providers.length)

### Listing Stored Secrets

The diagram below describes the listing of the secrets that are stored from one or more storage providers. The listing is based on reading the metadata of the  secret parts stored in the storage(s).

## Secret Storing Mechanism

Depending on the user's choice, an S secret sequence will be divided to n parts with the restore threshold as t (t <= n). Each of the n sections is stored in one storage among the user storages selected and authorized previously. To recover the S secret sequence, you need to obtain at least t of the n stored parts. To ensure safety, and avoid brute force attacks, the lib uses Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing) to split / combine the secret sequence.

To assist with listing and displaying information about stored secrets,sslib performs additional storage of the secret metadata on each storage. Thus, as long as a user has access to a storage, they will know information about the stored secret (s) through reading metadata.

The structure of the metadata looks like this:

```javascript
{
  "id": "id12345",
  "nickname": "my important key",
  "hint": "This fox jumps over the eagle",
  "threshold": 2,
  "otherParts": [
    {
	  "storage": "gdrive",
	  "cred": "***avt@gmail.com",
	  "extraInfo": {}
	},
	{
	  "storage": "onedrive",
	  "cred": "***uan@live.com",
	  "extraInfo": {}
	}
  ],
  "createTime": 1569226381000
}
```  
## API

The nickname and hint are optional information to help users remember their secret strings.

The structure of the main data (secret part) looks like this:

```javascript
{
  "id": "id12345",
  "data": "ThisIsASplittedPartOfSecret",
  "nickname": "my important key",
  "hint": "This fox jumps over the eagle",
  "threshold": 2,
  "otherParts": [
    {
	  "storage": "gdrive",
	  "cred": "***avt@gmail.com",
	  "extraInfo": {}
	},
	{
	  "storage": "onedrive",
	  "cred": "***uan@live.com",
	  "extraInfo": {}
	}
  ],
  "extraInfo": {
    "checksum": "123456"
  }
  "createTime": 1569226381000
}
```
In which:

data: the split part of the secret sequence
extraInfo: extra information (optional) that the App adds (lib does not care). For example, the App may choose to add the checksum value to verify that the secret sequence is recovered by lib recover.

### Add a storage to the managed list

Adds a storage provider to the sslib's managed list.

```javascript
setStorage(provider, storage)

#### Returns

### Connect/Authorize a storage

Connect to / authorize a storage provider in the list of added providers. In the case that storage is cloud service that supports Oauth (google drive, dropbox, ...), this API will perform Oauth login flow to save access token.

```javascript
connect(provider, [,info])
```
